## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to explore Flipkart's e-commerce transactional data using Python, SQL, and Power BI to extract business-critical insights. The focus is on identifying best-selling products, sales trends, revenue-driving categories, and customer purchasing behavior — without using Machine Learning.

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains order-level details such as:
- `OrderID`, `ProductName`, `Category`, `SubCategory`
- `OrderDate`, `CustomerID`, `Price`, `Quantity`

📁 **Dataset File:** [`flipkart_orders.csv`](flipkart_orders.csv)

## 📈 Insights & Findings

- Few products drive majority of revenue.  
- Electronics and Apparel dominate the revenue chart.  
- Seasonal trends spike around festive months.  
- High-value products ≠ highest selling products (margin vs. volume).  
- Sub-categories show great potential for optimization.

---

## 🧩 Business Recommendations

- Focus on high-revenue subcategories.  
- Promote slow-moving categories via bundles.  
- Prepare for festive spikes with smart inventory.  
- Push high-margin products via premium placements.  
- Use historical trends to personalize offers.
